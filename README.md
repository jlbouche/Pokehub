# Pokehub!

## Gotta index 'em all!

#### Professor Oak is recruiting for more professors throughout the Pokemon universe! Before you can prove yourself as a Pokemon Researcher though, he's requiring some hands-on training by sending you out into the world of Pokemon. Add new Pokemon, comment on special interactions you've had with them, and continue your journey in becoming a Pokemon master!

### [Heroku app](https://pokehubproject.herokuapp.com/)

## Icebox

### Due to time constraints there were a lot of implementations I put in the icebox--I tried playing with multer to allow users to upload an image when creating a pokemon, but it was consuming too much time. Allowing researchers to add a Pokemon Team to their profile, and noting what Pokemon they have added or made research notes on.
