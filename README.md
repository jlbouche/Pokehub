## Gotta index 'em all!

#### Professor Oak is recruiting for more professors throughout the Pokemon universe! Before you can establish yourself as a full-fledged Pokemon Researcher, he's requiring some hands-on training by sending you out into the world of Pokemon. Add new Pokemon, comment on special interactions you've had with them, and continue your journey in becoming a Pokemon master!

## Icebox

### Due to time constraints there were a few things I put in the icebox. I started steps with multer and GridFS to allow users to upload an image when creating a pokemon, created basic models/controller functions allowing researchers to add a Pokemon Team to their profile, and noting on their profile what Pokemon they have added or made research notes on. Would def like to continue those.
